# GTFS File Descriptions
# ======================
# Ref.:
# https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference

# agency.txt 
# Transit agencies with service represented in this dataset.
 
# stops.txt
# Stops where vehicles pick up or drop off riders. Also defines stations and station entrances.
 
# routes.txt	
# A route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single service.
 
# trips.txt	
# Trips for each route. 
# A trip is a sequence of two or more stops that occur during a specific time period.
 
# stop_times.txt
# Times that a vehicle arrives at and departs from stops for each trip.
 
# calendar.txt	
# Service dates specified using a weekly schedule with start and end dates. 
# This file is required unless all dates of service are defined in calendar_dates.txt.
 
# calendar_dates.txt	
# Exceptions for the services defined in the calendar.txt.
# If calendar.txt is omitted, then calendar_dates.txt is required and must contain all dates of service.

# Notes on specific fields from GTFS specification
# ================================================

# direction_id
# Indicates the direction of travel for a trip. This field is not used in routing; 
# it provides a way to separate trips by direction when publishing time tables. Valid options are:
# 0 - Travel in one direction (e.g. outbound travel).
# 1 - Travel in the opposite direction (e.g. inbound travel).

# block_id ~ Not provided in Diblin Bus data?
# Identifies the block to which the trip belongs. 
# A block consists of a single trip or many sequential trips made using the same vehicle, 
# defined by shared service days and block_id. A block_id can have trips with different service days, 
# making distinct blocks. See the example below

# Create an emtpy list to hold the GTFS data
data <- list()

# Get a vector of file names that have been unzipped
files <- list.files('ingestRawData/raw/')

# Avoid readtable cutting back precision
options(digits = 22)

# Loop through and add each file as an element to the list
